                               When it comes to informing the customers, we wanted the application to inform the customers when something is out of stock with simple tap actions instead of typing a full message. We broke down multiple item orders so the barista can only accept orders that are available. When an order is rejected, the application communicates with the server to auto-alert the customers.

                            <p>Users requested to have an option to alert the customers up to 10 minute delay instead of just 5 minutes during rush hours. We addressed this by including a 3D touch option to turn on the "x2" rush hour.</p>

                            <p>Users wanted a way to review order history, total sales, and tips per shift instead of the total list for the whole day. Because the review page is primarily used by the managers of the cafe, it was important for the user to understand the information per shift so tips and problems can be evaluated based on the baristas they are managing on each shift.</p> 

                            <h5>No Cancel Button</h5>
                            <p>“Why would the barista ever cancel an order once it’s accepted?” Because every order should be declined if not executable, users found the cancel button unnecessary. The owner of Pegasus Coffee Bar, John, also pointed out that cancel button can promote “lazy behavior” and would not want such option available.</p>

                            <p>Users wanted order details for each item in the new order list so baristas can make sure a specific flavor or milk alternative is in stock before they accept drink orders. Users also wanted to communicate the reason for decline, so the automated messages can be more personalized.

                                I conducted a comparative analysis of the services provided by Joe Coffee’s primary and secondary competitors. I found out that many services are integrated within the merchant’s order system through POS integration or print receipts (like Starbucks). I also found that many secondary competitors try to serve as a marketing/business analytics tools, providing dashboard and API services.
                                
                                I have observed that while these competitors have great focus on the user experience of customer side applications, the merchant-side applications are very simple, with few functionalities, or dispersed across different platforms (i.e. website dashboard, tablet/mobile application).

We used sans-serif font for the labels with font-size no smaller than 16pt for readability. Instead of Joe Coffee's bright red brand color, we used a <a href="Media/JoeCoffee/ColorPalette.png" target="_blank" class="joeLink">neutral color palette</a> that is comfortable for the eye.

            <h5>Emphasizing the Importance of Generative User Research</h5>
                             <p>We had the opportunity to work with a highly motivated client, with a clear understanding of the value of UX. However, as the user researcher, I learned that it was important for me to re-emphasize and demonstrate that although some research approaches can be seemingly out-of-focus for the client, it is a necessary step to understand the users so we can tackle the underlying problems and optimize our design solutions.</p>
                             
            <h5>Interviews are HARD</h5>
                <p>As I conducted user interviews, I realized how difficult it was to interview people – dealing with the awkward pauses, mistakenly asking dead-end questions, and missing opportunities to learn more. I realized it was very important to build a personal relationship with the participants so they feel comfortable, as they willingly start sharing in-depth details. I wish I had approached some of my earlier interviewees in a more friendly way so I could have gotten the rich story behind their experiences. </p>
            
            <h5>The Question of Accessibility</h5>
            <p> Although, we had our font-sizes and button sizes designed based on the HIG, we did not look into accessibility guidelines for our design, especially for visual impairment and color-blindness. I wish we had looked into voice interaction options and inclusive design solutions.
</p>
            <h5>Visual Design Research</h5>
            <p> Although our client did not specifically request for visual design work, we wanted to make sure the visual design aligned with our user research findings and enhanced usability. I learned that visual design aspect of a product is extremely hard to get it right. We had great usability testing results, but we would have highly benefited if I could have done some in-person visual design evaluations and compared multiple design variations. 
</p>
            <h5>Need for Visual Design System</h5>
            <p> Although we focused on the iOS tablet for this sprint, we realized that our solution will be implemented for Joe Coffee’s web application and android tablets. I learned that it would have been highly beneficial for our client to build a design system for type, color, and spacing, so they can have consistency across multiple platforms.
